# Detailed description

## Key Properties

### count

> Returns the number of elements in the current collection.

```ts
readonly type count = number;
```

### \_owner

> This is the object owned by the collection.

```ts
type _owner = object;
```

### \_elemTypes

> Define the type constraints for the collection element.

```ts
type _elemTypes = any[];
```

### \_list

> Array that stores the list of elements in the collection, which contains the actual data of the collection.

```ts
readonly type _list = any[];
```

### \_guid

> Unique identifier of the object (GUID). Uniquely identifies the object.

```ts
type _guid = string;
```

### \_type

> The generator function of the object, which was used when the object was created.

```ts
type _type = Function;
```


## Key Methods

### add()

> Add an element to the property collection.

```ts
type add = (key: string, elem: any, desc?: PropertyDescriptor) => number;
```
- key : The key of the key element.
- element : The element to be added.
- desc : Property descriptor object for element. Select value.
- return : Index of the added element.
### clear()

> Initialize the property collection.
> This method initializes the array '$elements', '$descriptors', and '$keys'.
> Events are not initialized.

```ts
type clear = () => void;
```

```js
myCollection.clear();
console.log(myCollection.count); // 0
```
### keyOf()

> Returns the key corresponding to the index of the property collection.

```ts
type keyOf = (idx: number) => string;
```
- idx : Index value to look up.
- return : The key corresponding to the index. If the index is out of range, it can return 'undefined'.

```js
const key = myCollection.keyOf(0);
console.log(key for index 0: ${key}');
```

### exist()

> Verify that the specified key exists in the property collection.

```ts
type exist = (key: string) => boolean;
```
- key - This is the key to check.
- return â€”Bulian value indicating the presence or absence of a key.

### remove()

> Delete an element in the collection.

```ts
type remove = (elem: any) => number;
```
- element : The element to be deleted.
- return : Index of the deleted element.

```js
const removedIndex = myCollection.remove(someElement);
console.log(`Index of deleted element: ${removedIndex}`);
```

### removeAt()

> Deletes elements in the specified location from the collection.

```ts
type removeAt = (pos: number) => boolean;
```
- pos : Index of the element to be deleted.
- return : Bullion value that indicates whether element deletion is successful.

```js
const success = myCollection.removeAt(0);
console.log(`Delete element successful: ${success}`);
```

### contains()

> Verify that the element exists in the collection.

```ts
type contains = (elem) => boolean;
```
- element : The element to be checked.
- return : A Boolean value indicating the presence or absence of an element.

```js
const exists = myCollection.contains(someElement);
console.log(`element exists: ${exists}`);
```

### indexOf()

> Returns the index of the key or element specified in the property collection.

```ts
type indexOf = (target: any | string, isKey?: boolean) => number;
```
- target : A key or element to look up the target. A string can be passed when viewed with a key.
- isKey : A bullion value that determines whether to look up with a key. Default is 'false'.
- return : Index of the element. Returns '-1' if the element does not exist.

```js
const index = myCollection.indexOf("key1", true);
console.log(`Index of key: ${index}`);
```
## Key Events

};
```

- \_this : current collection object.

```js
myCollection.onAdded = function(idx, elem, _this) {
	console.log ('After adding elements: index ${idx}, element ${elem}');
};
```

### onRemove

> An event that occurs before an element is deleted from the collection.

```ts
type onRemove = (idx: number, elem: any, _this: object) => void;
```
- idx : Index of the element to be deleted.
- element : The element to be deleted.
- \_this : current collection object.

```js
myCollection.onRemove = function(idx, elem, _this) {
	console.log(`Before element deletion: index ${idx}, element ${elem}`);
};
```

### onRemoved

type onRemoved = (idx: number, elem: any, _this: object) => void;
```
- idx : Index of deleted elements.
- element : Deleted element.
- \_this : current collection object.

```js
myCollection.onRemoved = function(idx, elem, _this) {
	console.log(`After element deletion: index ${idx}, element ${elem}`);
};
```

### onClear

> Events that occur before the collection is initialized.

```ts
type onClear = (_this: object) => {};
```
- \_this : current collection object.

```js
myCollection.onClear = function(_this) {
	console.log ('Before collection initialization);
};
```
